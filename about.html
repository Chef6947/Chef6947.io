          There are many arguments on this topic should drugs be legalized or should it not, according to <a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/criminal-law/should-drugs-be-legalized"target="_blank" class="source">cliffnotes.com</a>, Legalization of Drugs would free up roughly around 100 billion dollars that the goverment currently uses on the police, courts, and the corrections, It would also produce noteable tax revenu. The War on Drugs launched in 1971, and since then it has been considered a failure. With the legalization of drugs we would be able to further regulate its consumption. In the 1870s, the initial laws against opium were targeted towards Chinese immigrants. In the early 1900s, the first laws against cocaine were aimed at black men residing in the southern United States. The first regulations against marijuana in the 1910s and 1920s in the Midwest and Southwest regions were focused on Mexican migrants and Mexican Americans. Presently, there is still a significant disparity in drug enforcement and sentencing practices, with Latino and black communities being disproportionately affected. Roughly around 1 out of 5 people in the US are behind bars for drug offenses, even though they have not been convicted of a violent crime, Which contributes to over population of state prisons. Reducing those numbers of state prison can be achieved by focusing more on the most dangerous offenders as compared to the drug offenders. The legalization of drugs could potentially have a negative impact on private for-profit prisons. This is because a significant portion of the prison population is made up of individuals who have been incarcerated for drug-related offenses.  If drugs are legalized, there may be fewer people arrested and convicted for drug offenses, which could lead to a decrease in the overall number of people in prison. Private for-profit prisons make money from having inmates, so a decrease in prisoners could hurt their profits. However, the relationship between drug legalization and for-profit prisons is complicated, and other factors like government policies and contracts can also affect their profits. No Knock Raids were a product of The War on Drugs, and the problem with no knock raids is that according to the department of justice officers are required to announce who they are and why they are at the suspects house with a warrant at hand. Plus no knock warrants are mostly used in Minortity communities, in a study done by ACLU 39% of the SWAT teams searches were for Black individuals, and 11% for Latinos. For drug related no knock warrants for the Black and Latinos it was about 68%. The positive effects that drugs have like Psychedelics have are they are used to treat people with anxiety, deppresion, and PTSD. Although the treatments are just experimental and not accessible to many people. Another positive that would come with the legalizaton of drugs it may reduce the stigma associated with drug use, which could make it easier for people to seek treatment and support for drug-related issues. An advantage of drug legalization could be a possible decrease in the need for police to enforce drug laws, resulting in a reduction in the size and strength of police forces. A study that investigated the effects of marijuana legalization in Colorado showed a decrease in the number of arrests and citations related to marijuana, which suggests that police resources were allocated away from drug enforcement.
